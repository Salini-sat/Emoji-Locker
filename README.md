# 😃 Emoji Expression Locker

A facial expression–based authentication system where users log in using emoji-like expressions via their webcam! Built with Python (Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe) and a simple web interface.

## 🚀 Inspiration  
Typing passwords feels outdated — what if you could just **smile to unlock**?

We wanted to replace the **traditional alphanumeric passwords** with a more **natural, fun, and secure** method — using your own **facial expressions** as a key! EmojiLock brings a playful twist to authentication by letting users **register and login using emoji-like expressions**.

---

## ✨ What it Does

EmojiLock enables users to:
- ✅ **Register** by making a unique facial expression (e.g., 😊, 😮, 😡).
- ✅ **Authenticate** by repeating that same expression later — no typing required!
- ✅ **Run locally** in a terminal — no need for any web frontend.
- ✅ **Visual feedback** through webcam to guide expression capture.

🔐 Example Flow:
User: 😁 (Registers with a smile)
Later...
User: 😁 (Smiles again → Access Granted)
